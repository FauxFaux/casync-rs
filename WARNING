This code doesn't work. That shouldn't be a surprise, given it's on a
github repo with no releases and no description.

But, also, this code currently does not check nearly any integrity at all,
it will just generate complete nonsense and declare success. This is awful,
no tool should ever do that. Please don't look at my shame.
